# address-book
## This is a simple address book file wrote in 2011 using C
I can't run it on the visual studio C++ anymore. Many syntaxs used in 2011 is not working anymore. 
if you want to debug it, then put the file tongxunlu.dat under the directory D (fold D). Or you can just changed the path in the file and put it in whereever you want.
